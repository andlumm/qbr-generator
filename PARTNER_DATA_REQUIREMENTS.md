## 📈 Health Score Algorithm Specification

### Weighted Scoring Model

The partner health score provides a single metric (0-100) that combines multiple performance indicators:

| Component | Weight | Rationale | Calculation Method |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Revenue Performance** | 30% | Primary business value indicator | (Revenue Attainment / 100) * 30 |
| **Pipeline Health** | 25% | Future revenue predictability | ((Pipeline Coverage / 200) + (Conversion Rate / 50)) / 2 * 25 |
| **Engagement Score** | 20% | Partnership depth and commitment | ((Training Rate / 100) + (Portal Activity / 100)) / 2 * 20 |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | 15% | Service quality and brand protection | (CSAT Score / 5) * 15 |
| **Deal Velocity** | 10% | Sales efficiency and competitiveness | ((Win Rate / 40) + (1 - Sales Cycle Ratio)) / 2 * 10 |

### Health Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Health Level | Business Meaning | Action Required |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **85-100** | Excellent | Top-performing partner ready for strategic opportunities | Expansion investment, case studies, reference programs |
| **70-84** | Good | Solid performer meeting expectations | Continue current programs, identify optimization opportunities |
| **55-69** | At Risk | Below-average performance requiring intervention | Coaching programs, performance improvement plans |
| **0-54** | Critical | Poor performance threatening partnership | Immediate intervention, potential tier demotion |

### Implementation Formula

```
Health Score = (
  (Revenue_Attainment / 100 * 30) +
  (((Pipeline_Coverage / 200) + (Conversion_Rate / 50)) / 2 * 25) +
  (((Training_Rate / 100) + (Portal_Activity / 100)) / 2 * 20) +
  ((CSAT_Score / 5) * 15) +
  (((Win_Rate / 40) + (1 - Sales_Cycle_Ratio)) / 2 * 10)
)
```
