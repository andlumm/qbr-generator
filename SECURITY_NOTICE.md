# üö® SECURITY ALERT - API KEY COMPROMISE

## Issue
The OpenRouter API key was accidentally committed to the git repository and is now exposed in the commit history.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate OpenRouter API Key
- Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Delete the compromised key: `sk-or-v1-[REDACTED-OLD-KEY]`
- Generate a new API key
- Keep the new key secure and never commit it to git

### 2. Update Environment Variables
- Add the new API key to your local `.env.local` file:
  ```
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
  ```
- Update Vercel environment variables with the new key
- Redeploy the application

### 3. Git History Cleanup (Optional)
The exposed key is in git history. Consider:
- Using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
- Or create a new repository if the history is not critical

## Prevention Measures Implemented
- ‚úÖ Removed API key from all code files
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation to reference environment variables only
- ‚úÖ Added this security notice
- ‚úÖ Updated error messages to not reference the old key

## Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Use .gitignore** - Ensure .env files are ignored
3. **Regular key rotation** - Rotate API keys periodically
4. **Monitor alerts** - Pay attention to GitHub security alerts

## Status
- ‚ùå Old API key compromised and exposed
- ‚è≥ Waiting for new API key generation
- ‚è≥ Waiting for environment variable updates
- ‚è≥ Waiting for application redeployment

## Next Steps
1. Generate new OpenRouter API key
2. Update local and Vercel environment variables
3. Test QBR generation functionality
4. Consider repository history cleanup if needed
